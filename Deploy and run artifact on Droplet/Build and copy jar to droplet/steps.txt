# 📦 SUMMARY  
# These commands build a Java project using Gradle, copy the built jar to a remote server, list files, run the jar, and check running Java processes and open network ports.  
# Language/Platform: Bash (Linux/macOS)  
# What you'll learn: Building Java apps with Gradle, transferring files with SCP, running Java apps, and basic server diagnostics, deploying an application on a remote server.  
# Outcome: Your Java app is built, copied to a remote server, started, and you verify its status and network bindings.  
# Why this matters: These steps demonstrate a typical Java deployment workflow and server troubleshooting.  

# ------------------------------  
# 🧩 SECTION TITLE: Build Java Application  
# ------------------------------  
gradle build  
# ✅ What it does: Compiles the Java project, runs tests, and packages the app into a jar file inside 'build/libs/'.  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Produces the runnable Java archive needed for deployment.  

# ------------------------------  
# 🧩 SECTION TITLE: Copy Jar to Remote Server  
# ------------------------------  
scp build/libs/java-react-example.jar root@209.38.69.149:/root  
# ✅ What it does: Securely copies the built jar file to the `/root` directory of the remote server at IP 209.38.69.149 using SCP (SSH).  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Transfers the application so it can be run on the server.  

# ------------------------------  
# 🧩 SECTION TITLE: List Files in Current Directory  
# ------------------------------  
ls  
# ✅ What it does: Lists files in the current directory to verify the presence of 'java-react-example.jar'.  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Confirms the file is available before running it.  

# ------------------------------  
# 🧩 SECTION TITLE: Run Java Application  
# ------------------------------  
java -jar java-react-example.jar  
# ✅ What it does: Starts the Java application contained in the jar file.  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Runs your server or app so it begins serving requests or performing its function.  
After runnign the application it will listen on port 7071 on the remote but since it not yet open , we wont be bale to access it via the browser on that port. So we added a custom TCP firewall rule 
and open connection from all sources to make the application publically available from the browsers 

# ------------------------------  
# 🧩 SECTION TITLE: Check Running Java Processes  
# ------------------------------  
ps aux | grep java  
# ✅ What it does: Lists all running processes and filters to show only those related to Java.  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Verifies that the Java app is running and helps troubleshoot if it crashed or is missing.  

# ------------------------------  
# 🧩 SECTION TITLE: Check Open Network Ports  
# ------------------------------  
netstat -lpnt  
# ✅ What it does: Shows listening TCP ports with their associated processes.  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Confirms if your Java app is listening on the expected ports and helps diagnose network issues.  

# ------------------------------  
# 🔄 Equivalent PowerShell commands (Windows) and explanations:  
# - Build (if Gradle installed):  
#   gradle build  
#   # Same as Linux: builds the project.  
# - Copy file to remote (using scp in PowerShell or WinSCP GUI):  
#   scp build/libs/java-react-example.jar root@209.38.69.149:/root  
#   # Securely transfers file via SSH.  
# - List files:  
#   dir  
#   # Lists files in current folder.  
# - Run jar:  
#   java -jar java-react-example.jar  
#   # Runs the Java app.  
# - Check Java processes:  
#   Get-Process java  
#   # Lists running Java processes.  
# - Check open ports (PowerShell):  
#   Get-NetTCPConnection -State Listen | Where-Object { $_.OwningProcess -eq (Get-Process java).Id }  
#   # Shows ports listened to by Java processes.  

# ------------------------------  
# ✅ NOTES / GOTCHAS / TIPS  
# ------------------------------  
# - Make sure SSH access to the server is working before scp.  
# - If java command is missing, check JAVA_HOME or PATH environment variables.  
# - Use `nohup java -jar java-react-example.jar &` or a system service for running Java apps persistently.  
# - Use `netstat` or `ss` to check ports; on some systems `netstat` may be deprecated.
