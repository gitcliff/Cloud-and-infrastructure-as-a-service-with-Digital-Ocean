# ✅ NOTES / GOTCHAS / TIPS  
# ------------------------------  
# - 🆚 `openjdk-17-jre` vs `openjdk-8-jre-headless`:  
#   - `headless` skips GUI components—useful for servers.  
#   - Regular `jre` includes GUI dependencies—needed if running desktop Java apps.  
# - 💡 Verify installation with:  
#   java -version  
# - 🛡️ Always use `sudo` because installing packages requires admin rights.
